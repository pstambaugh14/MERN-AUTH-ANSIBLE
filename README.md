# MERN-AUTH-ANSIBLE
Ansible Script for Deployment of MERN-based authentication application.
This is one of my first projects so please be kind.
This isn't of much use other than that of practice for myself. 
Either way, I am open to positive or constructive criticism, please no trolls.


Beta 2.0 - Goal: Add Secure Variables for safe credential storage.
           Goal: Fix redundant/unnessary Code
           Goal: Re-Create Script to have application integrate with Systemctl as a daemonized application.
