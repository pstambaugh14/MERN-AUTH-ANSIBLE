# MERN-AUTH-ANSIBLE
created by: Patrick Stambaugh
Ansible Script for Deployment of MERN-based authentication application.
This is one of my first projects so please be kind.
This isn't of much use other than that of practice for myself. 
Either way, I am open to positive or constructive criticism, please no trolls.

Beta 2.0 - Goal: Add Secure Variables for safe credential storage. - Stored securely during the session with --ask-sudo-pass params in start script for ansible.
           Goal: Fix redundant/unnessary Code - slowly but steadily
           Goal: Re-Create Script to have application integrate with Systemctl as a daemonized application. - pm2 startup.  Easy! :)
           Goal: Add PM2! :) -- Goal Achieved locally.  Will Script into Ansible once completed. --GOALLLL achieved! :)
           Goal: HTTPS via TLS 1.2 - Managed to get HTTPS via self-signed cert.  
           Goal: Currently using HAProxy to load balance between two nodes using SSL Pass Thorugh.  Config file is posted.
           Goal: Add to Ansible Script the deployment of an HAProxy server and configure nodes behind the load balancer.
           Goal: Daemonize pm2 via systemctl in Ansible script -- DONE!!!
           Goal: Use a custom SSL Cert - as opposed to the ones automatically generated by webpack...
           Goal: Added into script a prompt for URI, username and password for MongoDB connection rather than having to manually edit keys.js.
           Goal: Add environment variables.  Done-ish.  Fixed the script so that it can be run universally.  Noticed I had my own local directories assigned to some configs and parts of scripts...
